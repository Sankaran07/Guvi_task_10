 1, Using the Python PIP command create a "requirements.txt" file from the Terminal / command-Prompt of your system?


    Certainly! To create a "requirements.txt" file using the terminal or command prompt,
    you can use the following steps:

    1, Open your terminal or command prompt.

    2, Navigate to the directory where your Python project is located using the cd command.
    For example:
                    cd path/to/your/project

    3, Run the following command to generate a basic "requirements.txt" file:
    For example:

                    pip freeze > requirements.txt

    This command captures the currently installed Python packages and their versions in the "requirements.txt" file.

    Now, you should see a file named "requirements.txt" in your project directory containing 
    the list of packages and their versions. 
    You can edit this file to specify the exact versions of the packages your project requires.

2, Using the Python PIP command install the Flask module < 2.0 into your system ?
 
    Certainly! To install a specific version of Flask (< 2.0) using the pip command,
    you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    For example:

            pip install Flask<2.0

    This command will install the latest version of Flask that is less than 2.0. If you want to install a specific version,
    you can replace <2.0 with the desired version number.
    For example:

            pip install Flask==1.1.2

    This command installs Flask version 1.1.2. Adjust the version number according to your requirements.
